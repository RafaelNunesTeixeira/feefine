    <strong>Expectations:</strong>
</p>

<p>
For this task, we want to understand your expectations of the other participants.
    </p>

    <p>
You will evaluate various situations that were part of the initial task. <strong>Your goal is to guess how the other participants perceived the situation.</strong> </p>

            <p> Several cases will be presented. For each case, you have to evaluate participant's entitlement associated to each behavior, from <strong>"no entitled" (1)</strong> to <strong>“completely entitled” (5)</strong>.</p>

            <p>A participant is entitled of their action if people perceive them as having the right to act in such way. </p>

            <p> The closer your guess is to the average opinion of the other participants, the greater your gain.</p>
            <p> <strong> You can earn up to 100 points</strong>. 50 points are subtracted from each point your guess is away from the actual number (at most 100 points are subtracted). </p>

            <p>
            One case will be randomly drawn for actual payment.
